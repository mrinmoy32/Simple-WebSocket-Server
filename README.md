# Simple WebSocket Server

This is a basic example of a WebSocket server and client implemented in Node.js and HTML. It allows you to establish a WebSocket connection and exchange messages between the server and client.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Simple-WebSocket-Server.git
cd Simple-WebSocket-Server
```

2. Install the project dependencies using npm.

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

1. Start the WebSocket server by running the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

2. Open the client.html file in your web browser. You should see a simple web page with an input field and a "Send" button.

3. Enter a message in the input field and click "Send." The message will be sent to the server, which will log it and send a response back to the client.

4. Check the browser's developer console to view the WebSocket connection status and messages sent and received.

## Acknowledgments

-This project uses the ws library for WebSocket implementation.
Feel free to modify and expand upon this basic example for your own WebSocket applications.

-You can add this README.md file to your repository to provide users with instructions on how to set up and use your Simple WebSocket Server project.
